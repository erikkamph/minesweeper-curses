# Minesweeper
The game is not 100% complete, there is still stuff to fix, 
for example if you loose it should reveal where all the bombs where.
## TODO
- [ ] When loosing reveal all bombs in the game.
- [ ] Have a timer while the game is running
- [ ] (Maybe) Accumulate score based on number in the current tile revealed.
- [ ] Fix better coloring of the program
- [ ] Implement a way to see if the user has won
